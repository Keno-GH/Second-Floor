    Staircase Upgrade Definitions (1.6)
    =====================================================
    These define the upgrade effects. Each upgrade references an upgradeBuildingDef
    that colonists will construct to apply the upgrade.
    
    ICON PRIORITY SYSTEM:
    1. If iconPath is specified, use that texture
    2. If no iconPath, use the LAST item from the upgrade's cost list (usually the rarest)
    3. If no cost list, use a default power icon (for instant upgrades)
    
    Example with custom icon:
    <iconPath>Icons/Upgrades/MyCustomIcon</iconPath>
